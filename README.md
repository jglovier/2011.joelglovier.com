:skull: My old website (circa 2011-2014) exported from WordPress to a static site.

At the time I created this website, I was really into a particular style of typography. I was inspired by condensed sans-serif typefaces like League Gothic, and traditional print mediums (like old time newspapers) that leaned heavily on complex typesetting to pack a lot of content into the available page real estate. That old look was something I was after reproducing on this site, and I might have gone overboard with it (as often we do when exploring new styles and approaches).

Apparently, I thought I had to put every link in the world into this site, and in hindsight I can also see that I lacked the discipline of being succint, and focusing on just the things that are most important with an approach like this. E.g. it's just a metric shit ton of content to wade through.

it was really fun to make, though. I explored using textures and CSS masks for the first time to give things a distressed look. I even made actual custom stamps that mirrorred the stamps on page.

It was also my first website fully-powered by WordPress. I've since exported it from WordPress to static markup, so there's some things that don't really work (in addition to API's that got deprecated or changed).

A final reflection: it's interesting to observe my own progression with things like this. I can see my progression in terms of design sense, and coding abilities and technical capabilities. I can also see the progression of my own consciousness in things like how and what I write about, and the language I was using at this time. There are things I wrote and ways of writing that I no longer use, from simple vernacular to how I articulate my own story, and bigger concepts like faith.

I'm sometimes tempted to be embarrassed about the way I used to do, see, think, or say things. But it was all part of my journey, and it's not something to be ashamed of – it's something to recognize as part of where I was then, and it's part of the path that led me to where I am now. Someday I will look back at where I am now and think similarly, no doubt. 

It's all part of a story that is continually unfolding.

IDK, maybe this is a lot for a README. :thinking::flushed::sweat_smile::satisfied:
